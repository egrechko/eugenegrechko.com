If you have a newer version of a Bitnami WordPress  then you might already have the letsencrypt scripts installed. You can skip this first section if this file exists.

```bash
/opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/scripts/generate-certificate.sh
```

## Download letsencrypt scripts

To download letsencrypt on your Bitnami instance you will need to download this [tar file](https://downloads.bitnami.com/files/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-20181008.tar.gz), extract it and then move it to the */opt/bitnami/* directory.

```bash
wget https://downloads.bitnami.com/files/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-20181008.tar.gz

tar -xzvf letsencrypt-20181008.tar.gz

sudo cp -r letsencrypt /opt/bitnami
```

## Install letsencrypt certificate

Now that you have the letsencrypt scripts on your server it is time to install your SSL certificate.  

Run the following code to install your certificate. **Make sure to replace 'YOUREMAIL' & 'YOURDOMAIN' with your actual email and domain** before running the command or you'll get nowhere. If you have more domains then add them with *-d domain.com*. 

```bash
sudo /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/scripts/generate-certificate.sh -m YOURMAIL -d YOURDOMAIN.com -d www.YOURDOMAIN.com
```

## Setup crontab jobs to auto renew your letsencrypt certificate

The script will ask you if you want have it automatically setup a crontab that will renew the SSL certificate every month. I always say yes since I see no reason why not. If you want to pass on this and add the cronjob manually you can do so like this.

- Open your crontab file

  ```bash
  sudo crontab -e
  ```

- Add the following line & make sure to change 'YOUREMAIL' & 'YOURDOMAIN' to the same values as when you initially installed the certificate.

  ```bash
  0 0 1 * * /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/lego --tls --email="YOURMAIL" --domains="YOURDOMAIN" --domains="www.YOURDOMAIN" renew && /opt/bitnami/apache2/bin/httpd -f /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/httpd.conf -k graceful
  ```



## Closing words

That's it you are all finished üëç. You can now visit your website  with *https://* and see that snazzy üîí on the left side of the url bar. 

If you are running WordPress I would suggest installing [Really Simple SSL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/) on your site to redirect http:// traffic to https://.
